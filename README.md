# Hello!
## I'm Noah Evans, a developer and the Founder of [Velocity Apps](https://velocityapps.tech).

## What do I do?
Way too many things.
I spend my free time making iOS and macOS apps, as well as Python programs. I seem to have a reputation of being the *'Twitter Bot Man'*, as I used to run many Twitter bots.
I'm currently learning Swift, and have a good understanding of Python and HTML.

## What am I working on now?
**Currently, I'm working on...**
* [What's Cooking](https://velocityapps.tech/whatscooking) - an app to help you decide what to eat
* More *secret* things at [Velocity Apps](https://velocityapps.tech)

## Want to contact me?
I'm taking a break from the internet so won't be responding to commnications on social media or via emails (unless I contact you first). I'm doing fine, and hope to be back soon. Stay well.
